# TODO:

- Make sure sphere distance algorithm is correct. 
    - Find appropriate distance threshold (GKCBR23 & CRUMB should highly overlap)
    - Then download all images from RADCAT. 
- Implement back-tracking for the duplicate removal algorithm.  
- Check if toothless is good. <<__`Waiting for email return`__>>
    - Otherwise just include what was given. _'Data is too confusing. Cannot assume 1409-0307 means J1409-0307, because is a legit result on Aladin Lite - for example.'_
- Kevin's Algorithm
- Only download sources that are captured by NVSS, FIRST and LOFAR.
- Change all 1e-x deg metrics to x arcsec. Or give a choice.
- Add FRIIRGCAT catalog.





# DNN Course
## Week 1:
- Recapping basic terms and definitions.
- `Assignment1`: Easy scikit-learn tutorial.

## Week 2:
- Neural Networks introduction
- Cover the fundamental algorithm of neural networks: `Backpropagation` (from first principles) (Need to show examiner that I know this algo for MSc Thesis)
- Shallow networks

## Week 3:
- Deep Learning
- Complications: Initialization of weights for DNN, Overfitting, Regularization, Activation functions, etc
- Basically what things had to be overcome to make a deeper network work.

## Week 4:
- CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks
- RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks (Neural Networks that 'rolls out' over time)

## Week 5:
- Generative models.
- Autoencoders and variational autoencoders.
- GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks.
