1. Sliding Window Issue:
    The index (names) of the sources were being given the index of the 
    sliding-window array that they were stored in, rather than the actual
    index name found in the index of the pd.Dataframe.

    Fixed this by converting index, for example 0, to 0 + df_index before storing.


2. Redundant Error Prevention
    There was code that had if statements to prevent errors from happening.
    However, due to earlier statements to prevent errors, some if statements
    used were unreachable. 

    Fixed by removing unnecessary code checks that were unreachable.


3. Changing Iterable Mid Loop
    I had an array of size three and wanted to loop through it. I also
    call array.remove() on that same array. Thought it was fine because
    nothing shouted. Came to realise that it only looped twice, which was 
    the new length of the array, rather than just looping through the remaining
    elemnets.

    Fixed by rather having a new array "removed" and call .append() on it 
    during the loop. Then loop throught that array and remove all elements from 
    other array.


4. Internal Duplicates
    Was not allowed to download file with a threshold of 0.

    Fixed by changing condition (not threshold) to (None == threshold).
    

5. SkyView Socket Timeout
    Sometimes when calling SkyView's API, the socket would timeout and an error would be thrown.
    This did not crash the software as the error was caught, but no indication to the user of an 
    error wouold ever be present.

    Fixed by reopening the communication socket and trying again when an error was detected.
